                            <h2 class="about-page-h2">From a Personal Perspective</h2>

                            <p> I am the proud dog mom of a one-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog, Poppy (or Popperino, Popperoni,
                                Popster, Chicken Nuggest, Sweet Angel, Popsalot...depending on the day)! I love spending my free time
                                snuggling her on the couch (she is a big snuggle bug) and watching a great show with my loved ones. I enjoy
                                staying active and waking up early to keep up with my consistent morning routine. I am on a mission to
                                limit my screen time (given the nature of my work) so I love winding down with a good book, a warm drink
                                and my comfiest pajamas. I am learning an old skill - acoustic guitar - as I used to play in high school
                                and enjoy the challenge beyond simply a deep love for music instilled in me from my dad. I am a traveler
                                by heart but a creature of routine. There is so much more I could share but for now I will leave you
                                with my favorite poem (courtesy of my dad): </p>

                            <div class="poem">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"Out of the night that covers me,</li>
                                    <li> Black as the pit from pole to pole, </li>
                                    <li> I thank whatever gods may be </li>
                                    <li> For my unconquerable soul. </li>

                                    <li> In the fell clutch of circumstance </li>
                                    <li> I have not winced nor cried aloud. </li>
                                    <li> Under the bludgeonings of chance </li>
                                    <li> My head is bloody, but unbowed. </li>

                                    <li> Beyond this place of wrath and tears </li>
                                    <li> Looms but the Horror of the shade, </li>
                                    <li> And yet the menace of the years </li>
                                    <li> Finds and shall find me unafraid. </li>

                                    <li> It matters not how strait the gate, </li>
                                    <li> How charged with punishments the scroll, </li>
                                    <li> I am the master of my fate, </li>
                                    <li> I am the captain of my soul."</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
